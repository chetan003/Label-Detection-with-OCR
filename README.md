# Label-Detection-with-OCR



A system has been created that seeks to extract information like nutrition table, data from barcode, food ingredient list, all from the food labels. The model extensively uses the OCR tool ’Tesseract’ and the model’s performnace do get impacted due to ineffective performance of Tersseract. Various other tools too have been tried and tested for this model but the Tesseract turned out to be the best among the open source tools. In future a developer can also use more
advanced non open source tools for better performance. The deployment of the current model has been done on streamlit. 

Currently the model lacks in incorporating the extraction of logo (organic or not) but in future that too can be
incorporated.
